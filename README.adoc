# Spring Cloud Stream TensorFlow Processor

A processor that evaluates a machine learning models built with link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[TensorFlow] and stored
in link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol Buffers] binary format.

The TensorFlow processor leverages internally link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/package-summary[TensorFlow Java API] library.

To learn more about this application and the supported properties, please review the following details.

To learn how to customize the processor for better fit different TensorFlow models, please review the
 the `Twitter Sentiment` and `Image Recognition` processors below.

*Object Detection Processor*  - The https://github.com/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/tensorflow/tree/master/spring-cloud-starter-stream-processor-object-detection[Object Detection] processor provides out-of-the-box support for the https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/README.md[TensorFlow Object Detection API]. It allows for real-time localization and identification of multiple objects in a single image or image stream. The Object Detection processor uses one of the pre-trained https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md[object detection] models and corresponding https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/865c14c/research/object_detection/data[object labels].

# ATTENTION!

Do not attempt to use/build from `master`; the `master` branch is currently undergoing redesign to adapt to Spring Boot and Spring Cloud 2.0 stack. You'd notice discrepencies and/or test failures.

Please use/build the 1.0.x branch or the http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/[Celsius.SR1 release] of the applications - it is the latest GA release.
