# Spring Cloud Stream TensorFlow Processor

A processor that evaluates a machine learning models built with link:https://www.tensorflow.org/[TensorFlow] and stored
in link:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol Buffers] binary format.

The TensorFlow processor leverages internally link:https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/java/reference/org/tensorflow/package-summary[TensorFlow Java API] library.

To learn more about this application and the supported properties, please review the following details.

# ATTENTION!

Do not attempt to use/build from `master`; the `master` branch is currently undergoing redesign to adapt to Spring Boot and Spring Cloud 2.0 stack. You'd notice discrepencies and/or test failures.

Please use/build the 1.0.x branch or the http://repo.spring.io/libs-release/org/springframework/cloud/stream/app/[Celsius.SR1 release] of the applications - it is the latest GA release.
