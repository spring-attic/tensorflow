/**
 * The TensorFlow evaluation result is represented by a list of (non-serializable) {@link Tensor} instances.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface are responsible to convert the result {@link Tensor} instances into
 * a serializable type that can be send as a Message.
 *
 * The default implementation coverts the the {@link Tensor}s into {@link Tuple}. Each tensor is encoded as:
 *
 * <li>
 *     	"type"  : TensorFlow {@link org.tensorflow.DataType} name
 *      "shape" : TensorFlow's shape
 *      "value" : ByteBuffer encoded Tensor's value.
 * </li>
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the consumers of this message to decode the Tuple back into {@link Tensor} instance.
 * The helper {@link TensorTupleConverter#toTensor(Tuple)} static method helps to do this.
 *
 * A better approach is to provide a custom {@link TensorflowOutputConverter} implementation.
 * @see <a href="http://bit.ly/2pKBghe">TwitterSentimentTensorflowOutputConverter.java</a> for how to build custom {@link TensorflowOutputConverter}.
